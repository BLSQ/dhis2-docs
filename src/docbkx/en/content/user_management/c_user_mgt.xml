        <title>About users</title>
        <para>Each user in DHIS2 has a user account which is identified by a user name. A user
            account allows the user to authenticate to system services and be granted authorization
            to access them. To log in the user must enter a valid combination of user name and
            password. If that combination matches a user name and password registered in the
            database, the user is allowed to enter.</para>
        <para>When you create a user, you should register the following information for each
            user:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>a first name</para>

                <para>a phone number</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>The contact information is important to get correct when creating new users since
            certain functions in DHIS2 rely on sending emails to notify users about important
            events. It is also useful to be able to communicate to users directly over email and
            telephone to discuss data management issues or to sort out potential problems with the
            system.</para>
        <para>A user in DHIS2 is associated with an organisation unit. This implies that when
            creating a new user account that account should be associated to the location where user
            works. For instance when creating a user account for a district record officer that user
            account should be linked with the particular district where she works. The link between
            user account and organisation unit has several implications for the operation of the
            system:</para>

                    organisation unit she is associated with and the organisation units below that
                    in the hierarchy. For instance, a district records officer will be able to
                    register data for her district and the facilities below that district
                    only.</para>

        <para>A user role in the DHIS2 context is a group of authorities. </para>
        <para>An authority in this regard means the permission to perform one or more specific
            tasks. For instance, a user role may contain authorities to create a new data element,
            update an organisation unit or view a report. Such a group of authorities constitutes a
            user role.</para>
        <para>When creating user roles such positions within the health system should be kept in
            mind and it is often sensible to create a user role dedicated for each of those
            positions. The process of creating user roles should be aligned with the process of
            deciding which users are doing what tasks in the system.</para>
        <para>First it should be defined which users should fulfill the role as system
            administrators. This will often a part of the members of the national HIS division and
            should have full authority in the system. Second a user role should be created roughly
            for each position. A sensible consideration of what authorities should be given each
            role must be done. An important rule is that each role should only be given the
            authorities which are needed to perform the job well - not more. When operating a large,
            centralized information system there is a need to coordinate the work between the people
            involved. This is made easier if only those who are supposed to perform a task have the
            authorities to perform it.</para>
        <para>In addition, a user role is associated with a collection of data sets. This affects
            the data entry module in that the user is only allowed to enter data for the data sets
            registered for her user role. This is often useful in situations where one wants to
            allow officers from health programs to enter data for their relevant data entry forms
            only.</para>
        <para>A user can be granted one or any number of user roles. In the case of many user roles,
            the user is privileged with the sum of all authorities and data sets included in the
            user roles. This means that user roles can be mixed and matched for special purposes
            instead of merely creating new ones.</para>
        <para>An important part of user management is to control which users are allowed to create
            new users with which authorities. In DHIS2 one can control which users are allowed to
            perform this task. In this process the key principle is that a user can only grant
            authorities and access to data sets that the user itself has. The users at national,
            province and district level are often relatively few and can be created and managed by
            the system administrators. If a large part of the facilities are entering data directly
            into the system the number of users might become unwieldy. Experience suggests that
            delegating and decentralizing this task to the district officers will make the process
            more efficient and support the facility users better.</para>
