  <title>A quick guide to DHIS2 implementation</title>
  <para>Any implementation of District Health Information Software (DHIS2) should aim at
    establishing sustainable systems that are flexible to changing needs in the health sector. It is
    important to acknowledge that this will take many years, with continuous structures for capacity
    building, best practise sharing, and innovation. This quick guide will provide a very crude
    overview of the different facets of DHIS2 implementation.</para>

        <para>A DHIS core team (DCT) of 4-5 people will be needed to administer a national HMIS.
          Their responsibilities and required skills should be clearly defined. The DCT will
          participate in DHIS2 Academies, organize training and enduser support for various user
          groups in the country. </para>

        <para>A Technical Steering Committee, or equivalent, will be needed to steer the
          coordination between health programs, other information systems and development partners
          and Universities. They will lead integration efforts and make decisions regarding the
          overall architecture of information systems. </para>

          <para>Throughout the implementation, simultaneous efforts of information system
            integration and data exchange need to be conducted. The leading principle for this work
            should be to create a decision-driven and indicator-focused system.</para>

          <para>An assessment needs to establish the needs for hardware. Desktops, laptops, tablets,

          <para>Information use must be a focus area from the start and be a component both in the
            initial system design and the first round of user training. Data collection and data
            quality will only increase with real value of the information. District review meetings
            and equivalent should be supported with appropriate information products and
            training.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Training will typically be the largest investment over time, and necessitates
            structures for continuous opportunities. Plan for a long term training approach catering
            for a continuous process of enabling new users and new system functionalities.</para>

          <para>Based on the decisions the system should support (system scope); customization and
            adaptation of the platform will be needed for DHIS2 aggregate, tracker, and/or events.
            Each action will need special competence, and should be led by the DCT.</para>

          <para>An understanding of the larger architecture of the HIS (the "HIS ecosystem") is
            important; what other systems are there, and how should they interact with DHIS2?
            Consider what needs there will be for interoperability between electronic
            systems.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>If there are needs that are not currently supported by DHIS2, an assessment of
            additional software development is necessary. These can be addressed locally by
            developing a custom web app or feed into the overall core platform development roadmap
            process organised by UiO. </para>

          <para>There are many different options for hosting an online system, bith in terms of
            where to put the server (e.g. in-house vs. cloud) and who to manage the server (e.g.
            in-house vs. outsourced). Server and hosting alternatives needs to be critically
            examined with regards to capacity, infrastructural constraints, legal framework,
            security and confidentiality issues. These desicions may need to be revisited at least
            annualy as server complexity, data types (e.g. aggegate vs. patient) and local capacity
            may change over time. </para>
