  <title>Multi-organisation unit data entry</title>
  <para>In some scenarios it is beneficial to enter data for multiple organisation units in the same
    data entry form, for instance if there are few data elements in the form and a huge number of
    organisation units in the hierarchy. In that case you can enable multi-organisation unit data
    entry by going to &quot;System settings&quot; and tick the &quot;Enable multi organisation unit
    forms&quot; setting. Then, in data entry, select the organisation unit immediately above the
    organisation unit you want to enter for in the hierarchy. Note that this only work for the
    &quot;section&quot; based forms. You should now see the data elements appearing as columns and
    the organisation units appearing as rows in the form. Note that the data entry forms should
    still be assigned to the facilities that you actually enter data for, i.e. the organisation
    units now appearing in the form.</para>
