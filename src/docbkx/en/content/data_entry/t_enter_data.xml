  <title>Enter data</title>
  <para>To open the data entry window hover over the Apps button. A drop down menu will appear
    listing the apps provided by DHIS2. Click on the <guibutton>Data Entry</guibutton>
    option.</para>
  <para>Start entering data by clicking inside the first field and type in the value. Move to the
    next field using the Tab button. Shift+Tab will take you back one step. You can also use the
    &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; arrow keys, as well as the Enter key, to navigate between
    the form cells. The values are saved immediately and do not require to be saved at a later
    stage. A green field indicates that the value has been saved in the system (on the
    server).</para>
  <para><emphasis role="bold">Input validation:</emphasis> If you type in an invalid value, e.g. a
    character in a field that only accepts numeric values you will get a pop-up that explains the
    problem and the field will be coloured yellow (not saved) until you have corrected the value. If
    you have defined a min/max range for the field (data element+organisation unit combination) a
    pop-up message will notify you when the value is out of range, and the value will remain unsaved
    until you have changed the value (or updated the range and then re-entered the value). </para>
  <para><emphasis role="bold">Disabled fields:</emphasis> If a field is disabled (grey) it means
    that the field can and should not be filled. The cursor will automatically jump to the next open
    field. </para>
  <para><emphasis role="bold">Data history:</emphasis> By double-clicking on any input field in the
    form a data history window opens showing the last 12 values registered for the current field
    (organisation unit+data element+categoryoptioncombo) in a bar chart. This window also shows the
    min and max range and allows for adjusting the range for the specific organisation unit and data
    element combination. </para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Follow Up:</emphasis> In the data history window there is also a
    feature to tag or star a value. E.g. a suspicious value that needs further investigation can be
    kept in the system, but marked for Follow-Up. In the Data Quality module you can run a Follow-Up
    analysis and view all values marked for Follow-Up, and then later edit the values if proved
    incorrect. </para>
  <para><emphasis role="bold">Audit trail: </emphasis>The audit trail allows you to view other data
    values which have been entered prior to the current value. As an example, the following data
    element was changed from its original value to 120. The audit trail shows when the data value
    was altered along with which user made the changes.</para>
