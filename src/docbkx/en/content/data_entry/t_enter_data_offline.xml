  <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Data Entry</emphasis> app works even if you don't have a stable
    Internet connectivity during the data entry. To use this functionality, you must login to the
    server while you've an Internet connection. If you loose the internet connection during data
    entry, you can still enter data into the data entry form. The data you enter is saved to your
    local computer, and then pushed to the server once you're connected to the Internet again. The
    total bandwidth usage is greatly reduced since forms no longer are retrieved from the server for
    each rendering.</para>

  <para>When the server is able to be reached through the Internet connection, a message is
    displayed at the top of the data entry screen:</para>

  <para>If the Internet connection should disconnect for some reason during the data entry process,
    this will be detected by the app, and you will be informed that your data will be stored
    locally:</para>

  <para>Data entry can proceed as normal. Once you have entered all of the necessary data, and the
    app detects that the server is back on-line, you'll be informed that you have data which needs
    to be synchronized with the server:</para>

  </para>
  <para>Once the data has successfully synchronized with the server, you'll receive a confirmation
    message that the data has been successfully uploaded to the server:</para>
