        <para>A validation rule group provides a mechanism for classifying related validation rules.
            Another advantage of using validation rule groups is that it can later be run
            separately, instead of running all validation rules.</para>
        <para>You can run the validation rules in a group interactively. To do so, choose Data
            Quality -&gt; Validation Rule. You can choose whether to run all validation rules in the
            system, or just the rules in one group.</para>
        <para>You can also run the rules in a group as part of a scheduled validation run, as
            described below.</para>
        <para>For each validation rule group, you can specify one or more groups of users to be
            notified of validation rule exceptions. Alerts will be sent to these users from
            scheduled validation runs, or from interactive runs when you request to send alerts. To
            set this up:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <?dbfo keep-together="always" ?>
            <listitem>
                <para>Be sure that one or more user groups contain all the users you wish to
                    notify.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Define a validation rule group for a set of validation rules. In the section
                    User groups to alert, select one or more user groups to be notified.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>By repeating these two steps, you can build any set of relations you need between
            validation rules and users to notify.</para>
        <para>When you create or edit a validation rule group, there is an option called <emphasis
                role="italic">Only organisation unit related users are alerted</emphasis>. If this
            is set to <emphasis role="italic">Yes</emphasis>, then each user in the user group(s)
            will be alerted only for validation exceptions in an organisation unit to which the user
            has been assigned through user management -- or for any lower-level organisation unit
            under the assigned organisation unit. If this is set to <emphasis role="italic"
                >No</emphasis>, then each user in the assigned user group(s) will be alerted for all
            validation exceptions in the group, regardless of their user-assigned organisation
            units.</para>
