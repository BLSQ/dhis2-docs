    <title>About predictors</title>
    <para>A predictor tells DHIS2 how to generate a data value based on data values from
        past periods and/or the period of the data value. It defines which past periods to
        sample, and how to combine the data to produce a predicted value.
        A predictor always generates an aggregate data value, but the past data values used to
        calculate the predicted value may come from aggregate data, event data, or both.</para>
    <para>A simple use of predictors would be to copy a past period data value into a
        new period, for example into the next month, or into the same quarter in the next year.
        A more complex use of predictors would be for disease surveillance, to predict what
        value would be expected in a given week or month of the year, based on previous
        data values. A validation rule could then be used to see how the actual value
        compares with the expected (predicted) value.</para>
    <para>You can specify the organisation unit level(s) for which a predictor will generate
        values. For example in disease surveillance you can use one predictor to give the
        expected value at each local facility, given the amount of variation you would expect
        at a single facility, while using a different predictor to estimate the value you
        would expect summed over all facilities in a district, given the (smaller) proportional
        variation that you would expect when adding up the values for all facilities
        in the district. You could also define additional predictors at any higher levels
        of the organisation unit hierarchy, where you might expect different proportions
        of variation. Alternatively, you can define a single predictor for all these
        levels and use the standard deviation function to determine what amounts of
        deviation were measured at each level.</para>
