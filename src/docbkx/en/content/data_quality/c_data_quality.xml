    <para>Good data quality is a key concern in building an effective HMIS. The <emphasis
            role="bold">Data Quality</emphasis> app contains tools to improve the accuracy and
        reliability of the data in the system. You can verify the data quality with the help of
        validation rules and various statistical checks.</para>
    <para>Data quality has different dimensions including:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Correctness:</emphasis></para>
            <para>Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There
                should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data
                elements.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Completeness:</emphasis></para>
            <para>Data for all data elements for all reporting organisation units should have been
                submitted.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Consistency:</emphasis></para>
            <para>Data should be consistent with data entered during earlier months and years while
                allowing for changes with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and consistent
                with other similar facilities.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Timeliness:</emphasis></para>
            <para>All data from all reporting organisation units should be submitted at the
                appointed time.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Data quality checking can be done through various means, including:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>At point of data entry, DHIS2 can check the data entered to see if it falls within
                the minimum maximum value ranges of that data element (based on all previous data
                registered).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Defining validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry.
                The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and organization
                unit(s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for these
                validation rules.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Analysis of data sets, that is examine gaps in the data.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Data triangulation, that is comparing the same data or indicator from different
                sources.</para>
        </listitem>
