    <title>DHIS2 as a Management Information System at PSI</title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">This interview was conducted in May 2016, with Sarah Romorini,
            senior program manager at PSI. The aim was to learn how DHIS2 was rolled out and how
            it's being used by PSI today. Sarah Romorini has worked with PSI for the past ten years,
            most recently with the implementation of DHIS 2.</emphasis></para>

        <title>About PSI</title>
        <para>Founded in 1970, PSI provides lifesaving products, clinical services and behavior
            change communication that empower the world’s most vulnerable people to lead healthier
            lives. PSI works in partnership with local governments, ministries of health and local
            organizations to create health solutions that are built to last.</para>
        <para>PSI has over 8,900 staff working on-site and with its affiliates in more than 60
            countries. In 2014, PSI’s revenue was calculated at $631,229,922 USD.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Why did you choose DHIS2 at PSI?</title>
        <para>In 2011, PSI began its search for a better Management Information System (MIS). Until
            then, we’d been using a different MIS in every country. Even within countries we'd have
            different systems for different projects. We were stuck with highly customized systems
            for every project; a mix of a Microsoft Excel, Access, and other tools. Programs were
            cobbling together pieces of information to see trends and analyze their programs.
            Accessing data like this wasn’t very efficient.</para>
        <para><emphasis><emphasis role="bold">All of these unique, siloed systems led PSI to reflect
                    upon two larger questions: how does PSI want to engage with its information,
                    both locally and globally? And how do we want data to influence both the
                    strategic and everyday program questions that PSI
            tackles?</emphasis></emphasis></para>
        <para>During its search for a new, global MIS, several different systems were considered but
            finally, DHIS2 was chosen for its ability to collect, manage, and visualize
            information…in essence, it was the system that made it easier for our programs to
            collect information and make data-driven decisions. It’s an incredibly powerful and
            flexible resource!</para>
        <para>We were attracted to DHIS2’s flexibility. For example, users can set up their own
            entry forms, indicators and reports. DHIS2 is easily integrated with other interfaces.
            We especially liked that data collection and monitoring can be adapted for all program
            areas, including referrals, health services, sales and distribution.</para>

    <section>
        <title>How did you roll out DHIS2? Was it a gradual process, district by district for
            example?</title>
        <para> No, we did it in true PSI fashion; we dived right in! We started with pilot projects
            that were rolled out nationwide in Kenya, El Salvador, Uganda and Senegal. It was a huge
            benefit to have a low-complexity country like El Salvador and a high-complexity country
            like Kenya and Uganda using DHIS2.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para>Kenya was PSI’s largest pilot project for DHIS2. In Kenya, there’s a wide range of
            programs on DHIS2, including malaria, HIV, family planning, social franchising,
            hypertension, sales, cervical cancer, and others.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para>In El Salvador, PSI’s reproductive health program was the first to join DHIS2. This
            helped monitor the effectiveness of interpersonal communication, quality assurance
            visits, provider performance, and helped the team identify trends and where to direct
            resources. It was incredible to see how program managers and supervisors began using
            DHIS2 to illustrate trends, gaps, and program needs.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">How many PSI countries are using DHIS2?</emphasis> After setting
            up our two pilot projects, DHIS2 grew very quickly. PSI has over 20 countries reporting
            their data using DHIS2 on the production server and several more are in development.
            Over 60 PSI countries use DHIS2 to report their monthly aggregated health services
            data.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">What are the differences between how PSI uses DHIS2 and how the
                Ministries of Health do?</emphasis> PSI and the MoHs are using the same MIS, that is
            to say DHIS2, but they are not using the same server. Since PSI and the MoH capture
            different information, we haven't created a parallel system. However, it enables the
            potential to share the information gathered by the other.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">How is DHIS2 making changes to its programs and
                businesses?</emphasis> DHIS2 could be used as just another MIS for data collection,
            but fortunately it’s used for so much more. Programs are using the information on DHIS2
            to influence their program decision making.</para>
        <para>This is also part of a larger behavior change process to make better use of data, and
            to help us direct where we apply resources</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">How do you implement DHIS2? Do you use consultants or local PSI
                teams?</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Local PSI DHIS2 stars.</emphasis> We’re working closely with
            PSI’s country teams so they feel empowered to use, manage, and analyze their data using
            DHIS2. During DHIS2 implementations, in-country DHIS2 stars are identified and PSI
            provides coaching and assistance to empower them to integrate data for decision making
            into their every day program management.</para>
        <section>
            <para>We also identify local technical leads who can support DHIS2 maintenance and adapt
                the system to meet their teams’ needs. For example, we’re implementing DHIS2 in
                Zimbabwe. Our team is working closely with our "local star" there, and he’s learning
                how to build and do the configuration himself. It’s exciting to see how DHIS2 is
                really owned by PSI Zimbabwe—the data in DHIS2 is theirs and they’re using it. This
                is the kind of goal we aspire to.</para>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">DHIS2 Builders and Architects.</emphasis> Configuring DHIS2 to
            meet a country’s data needs takes team work. To do this, PSI collaborates with “DHIS2
            builders,” who do the technical configuration work, that is, building the DHIS2 system
            to match the DHIS2 blueprint, which is based on the PSI country team’s data use
            needs.</para>
        <para>We collaborate with HISP agencies in India, Vietnam, Uganda, West Africa, and
            Colombia. We also work with BAO Systems, the largest US-based DHIS2 consulting and
            hosting firm in North America, for configuration support.<link
                xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://baosystems.com/"/>
            .</para>
        <para>DHIS2 builders are supervised by PSI’s DHIS2 architects. The DHIS2 architects are
            specialized PSI DHIS2 experts. They ensure our configurations are high quality, train
            local stars and help builders to learn our standards.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Do you provide DHIS2 training to PSI staff?</emphasis> As part
            of our long-term sustainability goals, we’re offering more training opportunities for
            local PSI staff on DHIS2 administration and data usage. Before, we would create these
            trainings a little on the fly because there were fewer countries, but now we’re starting
            to create more standard, ready-to-go training resources.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Which parts of DHIS2 are you using the most?</emphasis>  We're
            using the aggregate data forms most. PSI is looking into using Tracker to look at
            individual data, register individual cases, track individual cases and then conduct
            surveys. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">What’s the general feedback you get on DHIS2?</emphasis> It’s an
            incredibly powerful tool, but it’s not necessarily intuitive to create your own form or
            how you create your own dashboard. We’re looking to make that easier, and we’re
            identifying who really needs to be able to do what with DHIS2. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">How do you help DHIS2 users with the system?</emphasis> We’ve
            recently transitioned to BAO Systems to help PSI to field its Help Desk tickets. We try
            to have a local DHIS2 administrator in each PSI country we work in; this person can
            usually field basic questions, like how to reset a password, or intermediate ones, like
            how to create a new form.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Do you embed DHIS2 into other apps?</emphasis> PSI develops
            custom reports and apps to make real time data collection and analysis even easier. Our
            apps address key strategic and technical areas, including franchise management and
            provider performance, improving network quality, and case surveillance (such as
            malaria). </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Health Network Quality Improvement System (HNQIS)
                app.</emphasis> We developed the HNQIS app to improve network quality and provider
            performance. It helps Quality Assurance (QA) officers plan their supervision routes and
            target low-performing providers with high client volume. </para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">The malaria case surveillance mobile app. </emphasis> PSI uses
            this app in Cambodia to report positive malaria cases in almost real-time. Pharmacists
            collect basic data points such as geographic location, type of malaria detected and age
            and gender of the client. It helps us to identify outbreaks and re-direct resources to
            where they are the most needed. You can check out the app here: <link
