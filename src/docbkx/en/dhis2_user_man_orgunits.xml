    <para>The organisation unit hierarchy defines the organisation structure of  DHIS 2, for example
      how the health facilities, administrative areas and other geographical areas are arranged with
      respect to each other. It is essentially the &quot;where&quot; dimension of DHIS 2, similar to
      how periods represent the &quot;when&quot; or time dimension. DHIS 2 is structured so that the
      organisational unit hierarchy is a geographical hierarchy, and the GIS module depends on this.
      <?oxy_comment_start author="cecilia" timestamp="20160513T122819+0200" comment="For SME: Still not encouraged?"?>Non-geographical

    <para>The design of the organisation unit hierarchy determines the geographical units of
      analysis available to the users as data is collected and aggregated in this structure. You can
      only have one organisational hierarchy at the same time so you must carefully plan its
      structure.</para>

      hierarchy<?oxy_comment_end?> is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographical
      dimension. Typically national organisational hierarchies in public health have four to six
      levels, but DHIS 2 supports any number of levels.</para>
    <?oxy_comment_start author="cecilia" timestamp="20160513T124401+0200" comment="Review section, too many &quot;for example&quot;"?>
    <para>The organisation unit hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations. A country might for
      example have eight provinces, and each province might have a number of districts as children.
      Normally the health facilities (from which data is typically collected) will be located at the
      lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, for example national or
      provincial hospitals. Therefore, skewed organisational trees are supported (for example a

      <para>It is easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy.  at a later stage, the
        only problem is changing organisational units that collect data (the leaf nodes), for
        example splitting or merging health facilities. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based
        on the current hierarchy at any time and will always reflect the most recent changes to the
        organisational structure.</para>

      <?oxy_comment_start author="cecilia" timestamp="20160513T150227+0200" comment="For SME: Isn&apos;t this section the same as above? Review content with SME."?>
      <para>Because the most recent information which is contained in the organisational unit
        hierarchy is always used for aggregation, it is important to keep in mind that changes to it
        (such as the division of districts into two separate districts) will not be respected over
        time. As an example, District A may be sub-divided into District B and District C. This is a
        process which often happens for political reasons. Facilities which belong to District A
        would need to be reassigned to District B and C. However, any historical data, which was
        entered before the split actually occurred, would still be registered as belonging to
        District B and C and not the defunct District A. This temporal representation of the
        organisational hierarchy across time will be lost. </para>

    <title>Create an organisation unit</title>
    <para>This is where you can create organisation units (from now on referred to as organisation
      units) and build up the organisation unit hierarchy. Organisation units are added one by one
      as either root unit or a child of a selected unit. The left side menu represents the current
      organisational hierarchy and if you select a unit there you will see its children listed in
      the main list of organisation units in the middle of the screen. When an organisation unit is
      selected in the left side menu you can also add new child units to it. To locate an
      organisation unit in the hierarchy you can either navigate through the tree by expanding the
      branches (click on the + symbol), or search for it by opening the search field (click the
      green symbol above the root of the hierarchy). In search you can either search for the
      organisation unit name or its code, both will only show exact matches (case-insensitive). To
      add a new organisation unit first select its parent and then click on the Add new button in
      the top right corner of the list of organisation units. To add a new root organisation unit
      make sure no organisation unit is selected in the menu and click on &quot;Add
      new&quot;.</para>
    <para>To edit the properties of an existing organisation unit first select its parent (if any)
      in the left side menu, then locate the organisation unit in the listed organisation units, and
      click on the name of the organisation unit that you want to modify. A context menu will
      appear, and you should select &quot;Edit&quot;. Refer to the screen-shot below to see how it
      works.</para>

        <para>Registers data: This property is used to identify which organisation units that can
          register data or not. Sometimes administrative organisation units at higher levels in the
          hierarchy are not supposed to register any data. This can help control the data entry
          process as only organisation units with this property set to Yes will be available for
          data entry.</para>

          coordinates of the organisation unit in this field, either a polygon (for organisation
          units that represent an administrative boundary) or a point (for health facilities).
          Without this information the GIS module will not work. It might be more efficient to
          import these coordinates later as a batch job for all organisation units using the import

  </section>
  <section xml:id="ou_groupsets">
    <title xml:id="orgunitGroupSets">Create an organisation unit group set</title>
    <para>Group sets can be understood as a flexible tool to add more categorisation to organisation
      units. Any number of group sets can be added, but as a default start all databases will have
      the two group sets &quot;Type&quot; and &quot;Ownership&quot;. Using these group sets will
      simplify how reporting is done, and facilitate analysis through the use of tools such as Excel
      PivotTables.</para>
    <para>While a group set like &quot;Type&quot; describes a measure dimension, the actual
      categories are represented by the groups, and the categorisation of an organisation unit
      through the organisation unit&apos;s group memberships. This can be understood as a parallel
      hierarchy of organisation units with the group set as the root (&quot;Type&quot;), the groups
      at level 2 (e.g. &quot;Clinic&quot;, &quot;Hospital&quot;, &quot;Dispensary&quot;), and the
      actual organisation units at level 3. The group set can as such provide additional information
      and dimensionality to the data analysis as data is easily filtered, organised, or aggregated
      by groups within a group set.</para>
    <para>For this aggregation to work without any duplication in the data some rules are necessary.
      A group set is always exclusive, which means that an organisation unit cannot be member of
      more than one group in a group set. Therefore, when creating a new organisational unit, you
      will only be allowed to select a single organisational group membership for each group set.
      Furthermore it is possible to define whether a group set is compulsory or not, which will
      affect the completeness of the data when analysing data using group sets. Compulsory means
      that ALL organisation units must be member of a group in that group set.</para>
    <para>We recommend that you approach the organisation unit grouping in the following sequence
      (and one group set at a time):</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Define a new group set, such as &quot;Location&quot;.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Add new groups (such as &quot;Urban&quot;, &quot;Rural&quot; and
          &quot;Peri-urban&quot;). Once all groups have been defined, return to the organisational
          unit group set and assign each of the desired groups to the group set.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Go back to each group, one by one, go to edit mode and assign the organisation units
          that should be member of the group. Should you follow this route, you can place multiple
          organisation units at a time in a group. However, you must be careful not to place the
          same organisational units in two groups which itself is a member of an organisation unit
          group set. This will result in a data integrity violation. If you have organisation unit
          groups which are not exclusive, they should not be members of a group.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>A better way to ensure that you do not mistakenly assign an organisation unit to
          multiple members of a group set is you can use the edit feature of each organisational
          unit to assign memberships to each group set. You will only be able to assign a single
          organisation unit at a time however.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>It is important to keep in mind when using the &quot;Organisational unit group&quot; set
      function, that unless great care is taken, organisational units can be assigned to multiple
      groups of a group set. This can be checked through the &quot;Data Integrity&quot; module,
      which will report which organisational units are not members of a compulsory organisational
      unit group set, and which organisational units have been assigned to more than one member of a
      group set.</para>
    <para>To create an organisation unit group set:</para>
    <para>Click on the name of the organisation unit group set you want to modify, followed by
      &quot;Edit&quot; from the context menu which will appear. The following properties can be
      defined in the Edit (or Create new) window:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Name: Provide a precise name for the group set.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Description: Describe the phenomena the group set is measuring/capturing.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Compulsory: Indicate whether ALL organisation units need to be member of a group in
          this group set or not.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Available groups/Selected groups: Here you assign groups to your group set by using
          the arrow buttons to move highlighted groups between the two lists (/selected). If no
          groups appear in the list then you must go to organisation unit groups and create new
          groups there first. Note that assigning groups that will violate the exclusive rule on
          group sets is not possible, e.g. adding a group that already has assigned an organisation
          unit that again is already member of a group that has already been selected by this group
          set, will not be possible since one organisation unit will end up with two group
